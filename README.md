# SCUFFLE

This is a <b>WIP</b> game that I am working on to play with my family during self isolation. (My families version of "Bananagrams")

## RULES
Object: Be the player with the most letters by the end of the game

This game starts with 144 letter tiles facedown in the center.

#### HOW TO PLAY
Each player takes turns flipping 1 letter at a time in the center. Whenever any player sees a word that can be made of <b>3 or more</b> flipped letters they must call it out and collect their word. At any time the player can transform their word into a longer (and different) one given they use all of the letters AND at least one from the center

##### STEALING LETTERS
A word can be stolen from another player <b>at any time</b> provided that word can be turned into a different word using <b>ALL</b> of the letters <b>+ at least 1</b> letter from the center

##### WINNING
When all of the letters from the center have been flipped and nobody has any steals/words to create using the center letters then the game is over. The player with the most letters wins the game.
